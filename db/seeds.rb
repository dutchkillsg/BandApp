# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Venue.create ({name: 'MSG', city: "NYC", state: 'New York', family_friendly: true})

# Venue.create ({name: 'City Field', city: "NYC", state: 'New York', family_friendly: true})
# Venue.create ({name: 'Jiffy Lube Live', city: "Reston", state: 'Virginia', family_friendly: false})
